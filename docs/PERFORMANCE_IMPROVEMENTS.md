# Performance Improvements

## Areas to Improve
- Optimize virtual scrolling and caching for large datasets (tables, order books)
- Debounce/throttle expensive operations (chart updates, network requests)
- Profile rendering performance and memory usage
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders in React components
- Use React.memo and useCallback where appropriate
